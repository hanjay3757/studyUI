Use the attached image only to reference the baby bear’s body shape, fur texture, apron design, and overall visual style.
Do not include any background or facial texture from the reference.
Do not use or render any visible teeth or deep inner mouth details — none should appear.

The baby bear’s mouth should appear soft and cartoon-like, placed just below the nose.
It is slightly open in an oval shape with only a round pink tongue inside — no teeth, no gums, no hard shadows.
The mouth must feel shallow and cute, not realistic.




Scene:
The bear is waking up in bed, arms stretched, mouth softly open in a sleepy yawn.
Sunlight gently lights the room through a wooden window.
The bear lies under a carrot-patterned blanket.
Its face looks relaxed and warm with closed eyes and a soft open mouth.

Use high-quality 3D animation with soft golden light, cozy textures, and peaceful morning atmosphere.






Same character style as before. The bear’s face and mouth should be fully 3D animated and expressive.

Scene:  
The baby bear walks into the wooden kitchen, rubbing its tummy with both paws.  
It pauses and says softly, “I’m hungry…” with a pouty expression.  
The mouth moves naturally while speaking.  
Its eyes are wide and sad, and the belly makes a tiny growl sound.  
Soft morning light fills the kitchen.  
The camera stays at eye level, showing the whole body.

Maintain consistent style and lighting from previous scenes. Facial animation must be soft and natural.

Scene:  
The bear opens the refrigerator. Inside, it’s completely empty — except for a lonely rolling carrot.  
The bear gasps, and its expression changes to shocked disappointment.  
It drops to the floor dramatically and says, “Oh no…” in a small voice.  
The fridge light casts a glow on its surprised face.  
Its ears droop, and its mouth forms a little “O” shape, fully animated.  
The camera captures the bear and fridge from the side.


Keep using the same character. The bear’s face must now look bright and determined, fully animated.

Scene:  
The baby bear stands up suddenly with energy.  
It nods to itself and grabs a small cloth shopping bag.  
It walks to the wooden door and opens it — outside is a sunny forest path.  
The bear turns to the camera, waves, and says cheerfully, “Let’s go shopping!”  
Its mouth moves naturally as it speaks, and its body bounces slightly with excitement.  
Warm sunlight pours into the room.  
The camera slowly follows the bear as it walks outside.
