Use the attached image only to reference the baby bear’s body shape, fur texture, apron design, and overall visual style.
Do not use or include the background from the image.
Do not copy the facial expression — the bear’s face must reflect the current emotion in the scene.
Do not display the reference image in the output — apply only its visual features.

Recreate the bear as a fully animated 3D character.
The bear must have a soft, expressive face.
Its mouth should be modeled in 3D, with visible depth and natural lip motion.
The inside of the mouth should show a small pink tongue (no visible teeth).
The expression must appear natural and match the scene’s emotion.


scene 1 = 
The baby bear lies in bed in a cozy wooden bedroom.
Morning sunlight shines softly through the window.
The bear is yawning with its mouth open, eyes gently closed, and arms stretched.
Inside the open mouth, a small pink tongue is visible — soft and round, not sticking out.
The mouth looks soft and cartoon-like, without showing any teeth.

The blanket has a carrot pattern and covers the bear’s lower body.
The camera remains still and focused on the bear’s face and upper body.
Use soft golden lighting and realistic fur rendering.
The scene should feel peaceful, warm, and cozy.





Same character style as before. The bear’s face and mouth should be fully 3D animated and expressive.

Scene:  
The baby bear walks into the wooden kitchen, rubbing its tummy with both paws.  
It pauses and says softly, “I’m hungry…” with a pouty expression.  
The mouth moves naturally while speaking.  
Its eyes are wide and sad, and the belly makes a tiny growl sound.  
Soft morning light fills the kitchen.  
The camera stays at eye level, showing the whole body.

Maintain consistent style and lighting from previous scenes. Facial animation must be soft and natural.

Scene:  
The bear opens the refrigerator. Inside, it’s completely empty — except for a lonely rolling carrot.  
The bear gasps, and its expression changes to shocked disappointment.  
It drops to the floor dramatically and says, “Oh no…” in a small voice.  
The fridge light casts a glow on its surprised face.  
Its ears droop, and its mouth forms a little “O” shape, fully animated.  
The camera captures the bear and fridge from the side.


Keep using the same character. The bear’s face must now look bright and determined, fully animated.

Scene:  
The baby bear stands up suddenly with energy.  
It nods to itself and grabs a small cloth shopping bag.  
It walks to the wooden door and opens it — outside is a sunny forest path.  
The bear turns to the camera, waves, and says cheerfully, “Let’s go shopping!”  
Its mouth moves naturally as it speaks, and its body bounces slightly with excitement.  
Warm sunlight pours into the room.  
The camera slowly follows the bear as it walks outside.
