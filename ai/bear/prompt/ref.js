Use the attached image as the only reference for the bear character.  
The character must exactly match the appearance, proportions, and style in the image:  
– a small, fluffy baby bear with soft brown fur, big round eyes, a chubby body, short limbs, a cute button nose, and slightly oversized ears.  
– The bear wears a tiny apron with a carrot design.

Scene description:  
Inside a cozy, warmly lit wooden kitchen in a log cabin, a large metal hotpot is placed on the front burner of a gas stove, positioned close to the camera.  
Behind the pot, partially obscured, stands the small baby bear on a wooden stool.  
The pot should naturally block part of the bear’s body from view, such as the lower torso, creating a realistic depth of field.  
The bear is not holding anything and is not interacting with the pot.  
It is simply looking forward with a peaceful expression, softly illuminated by golden morning sunlight coming through the nearby window.

Important positioning:  
– The hotpot must be in the foreground, fully visible and centered.  
– The bear must be positioned behind the hotpot, with the lower body partially hidden by the pot.  
– The bear should not appear to be standing inside or on top of the pot.  
– Carefully adjust the bear’s position so that it is spatially and visually behind the hotpot, maintaining natural proportions and depth.

Visual style:  
High-quality 3D animation, soft and realistic lighting, cinematic camera angle, detailed textures, and believable fur rendering.  
The atmosphere should feel peaceful, cozy, and heartwarming inside the wooden kitchen.

– Avoid unnatural overlaps: the bear should never appear inside or above the pot  
– Do not change object positions mid-scene (no sudden movements or teleporting)  
– Maintain full consistency with the character’s appearance and proportions from the reference image  
– Emphasize warm natural lighting and depth of field to create realistic foreground/background layering
